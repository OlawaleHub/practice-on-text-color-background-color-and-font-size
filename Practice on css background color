								<p style="color:white">I could see her portrait;
								<br>
On my flashy mirror
<br>
It glistens with her beauty,
<br>
On my thoughtful melancholic face
<br>
It is like the gad of green leaves
<br>
Sparkled with drops of water
<br>
From the morning dew
<br>
— Fresh
<br>
Black beauty. </p>
<br>
<p style="color: orange; font-size:1.2rem">I could see dark melanin
<br>
Popping on her skin, 
<br>
With some traces of pink
<br>
Encircling her full lips. 
<br>
And the dainty face of her beauty
<br>
Taking possession of  my thoughts.
<br>
Descendant of the Angels
<br>
— a fairy. </p>
				</body>
				<br>
				<p>How do I explain,
				<br>
a teetotaler who got drunk
<br>
Or an atheist who saw God?
<br>
I have no wisdom to explain this beauty.
